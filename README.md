### Go Fish
##### Overview
This version of Go Fish uses two players to play the traditional game of Go Fish.
##### How the Game Works
The controls are entirely by voice activation. It's you versus the computer. You ask for cards until there is a winner determined by the rules of Go Fish.
##### Technology Used
This application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More specifically it uses the Javascript library [Speech Recognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition)
##### Unsolved Problems
Since this Speech Recognition API is experimental, there has been some linguistics issues using this API.

NOTE: This game is unfinished and it doesn't end.

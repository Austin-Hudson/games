### Go Fish
##### Overview
This version of Go Fish uses two players to play the traditional game of Go Fish.
##### How the Game Works
The controls are entirely by voice activation. It's you versus the computer. You ask for cards until there is a winner determined by the rules of Go Fish.
##### Technology Used
This application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More specifically it uses the Javascript library [Speech Recognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition)
##### Unsolved Problems
Since this Speech Recognition API is experimental, there has been some linguistics issues using this API.

In the future I would like to add button functionality as well, so the user doesn't need to rely on their voice to play.
### War
##### Overview
This version of War uses two players to play the traditional game of War.
##### How the Game Works
The controls uses mouse clicks. It's you versus another person. The
key presses do everything for you. When there is "War", the application solves the answer and outputs the flipped over cards. It uses the traditional rules of War to play the game.
##### Technology Used
This application uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
##### Unsolved Problems
The game has been working as intended until there are some "War" nuances in the game. For instance if they player doesn't have enough cards to do war.

I plan on expanding the controls. So both players don't press the same button to play as well as adding statistics to it for the players.
